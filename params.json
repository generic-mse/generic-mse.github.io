These code, packages in R and libraries in languages such as C++ for the conditioning of Operating Models (OMs), running simulations, building Management Procedures (MPs) and presenting results and summary statistics. \r\nIn some cases existing stock assessment methods, such as Multifan-CL and Stock Synthesis, are being used to construct OMs conditioned on stock assessment data sets and to develop Management Procedures (MPs), e.g. ASPIC.  \r\n\r\nMuch of the software is available from github repositories or in the case of R packages from CRAN. \r\n\r\n## CCSBT\r\nThe MSE process was fully completed in costume-made software programmed in ADMB which include the operating model (for assessments), projections, and management procedures. The source code and R-package for evaluating outputs is maintained through a private (available to members) git repository. The main link for the commission for reports etc can be found at http://www.ccsbt.org.\r\n## IATTC\r\n    SS3 as a platform to generated operating models conditioned on data.
